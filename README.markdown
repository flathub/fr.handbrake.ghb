# HandBrake on Flathub

This is where HandBrake Flathub builds are hosted.

All HandBrake development, including maintenance of Flatpak manifests, is performed in our [HandBrake GitHub repository](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake).  Please report any issues or create pull requests there.

# Generating a new Flathub release of HandBrake

The manifest file `fr.handbrake.ghb.json` can be generated by HandBrake's build system after a release tag has been set and the release source package has been made available for download.  The source package URL and SHA256 sum are required to generate the flatpak manifest.

E.g. to generate the flatpak manifest for HandBrake's 1.1.2 release
```
git clone https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake.git
cd HandBrake
git checkout 1.1.2
./configure --flatpak
cd build
make pkg.create.flathub \
 HB_URL=https://download.handbrake.fr/releases/1.1.2/HandBrake-1.1.2-source.tar.bz2 \
 HB_SHA256=ba9a4a90a7657720f04e4ba0a2880ed055be3bd855e99c0c13af944c3904de2e
```

The manifest file will be written to `pkg/flatpak/fr.handbrake.ghb.json`. Copy this manifest to your fork of the [HandBrake Flathub repository](https://github.com/flathub/fr.handbrake.ghb).  Then create a new PR for the release.  You should invoke a test build of your PR by including the phrase `bot, build` in your PR comments.
